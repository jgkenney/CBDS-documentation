\begin{enumerate}
\item ssh -p 810# username@162.246.6.26
\item ssh into cloudnode# that needs passwordless login
\item navigate to ~ (should be here by default)
\item sudo mkdir -p .ssh
\item sudo chown -R username:group .ssh (if not in your username already)
\item ssh into cloudnode1
\item ssh-keygen -t rsa (if not previously created)
\item cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -p 810# username@cloudnode# 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
\item ssh -p 810# cloudnode# (ssh to node to test everything works ok)
\end{enumerate}
