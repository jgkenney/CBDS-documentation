\section*{Passwordless-ssh node login}
user denotes the first part of your SCSU email.  For example, if your email is gausc1@southernCT.edu your user will be gausc1.\\\\N denotes the number for cloudnode (cloudnodeN) and node number (810N) ie N=1 would indicate cloudnode1 and nodenumber 8101.\\\\
\textasciitilde{}/ denotes the user's home directory ie [user@cloudnodeN \textasciitilde{}] \$\\\\\textgreater denotes terminal output\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open your terminal\\

\item Connect to cloudnode1

Type:  ssh -p 8101 user@162.246.6.26\\


\item Enter your password\\
\textgreater user@162.246.6.26's password:

Type:  scsu12345

scsu1235 is the default password for all new users on all nodes\\


\item Change your password

type:  sudo passwd user

\textgreater[sudo] password for user:

type: scsu12345

\textgreater Changing password for user.

\textgreater New password:

enter a new password

\textgreater Retype new password:

Re-enter your new password\\


\item Login to another node and change password

type:  ssh -p 8102 cloudnode2

Enter your password when prompted

Repeat step 4 on this node to change your password, use the same password for all nodes.

Repeat step 5 for all remaining nodes.\\


\item Copy passwordless-ssh.sh, rsa-keys.sh, and permissions.sh from /scripts on cloudnode1 into your home (\textasciitilde{}/) directory on cloudnode1

type:  scp -P 8101 /scripts/rsa-keys.sh cloudnode1:\textasciitilde{}/rsa-keys.sh

type:  scp -P 8101 /scripts/passwordless-ssh.sh cloudnode1:\textasciitilde{}/passwordless-ssh.sh

type:  scp -P 8101 /scripts/permissions.sh cloudnode1:\textasciitilde{}/permissions.sh\\


\item Copy passwordless-ssh.sh, rsa-keys.sh, and permissions.sh from your home (\textasciitilde{}/)on cloudnode1 into your home (~/) directory on cloudnodeN (N=2-5)

type:  scp -P 810N \textasciitilde{}/rsa-keys.sh cloudnodeN:\textasciitilde{}/rsa-keys.sh

type:  scp -P 810N \textasciitilde{}/passwordless-ssh.sh cloudnodeN:\textasciitilde{}/passwordless-ssh.sh

type:  scp -P 810N \textasciitilde{}/permissions.sh cloudnodeN:\textasciitilde{}/permissions.sh\\


\item Run passwordless-ssh.sh

In your home, [user@cloudnode1 ~] \$), type:
./passwordless-ssh.sh

\textgreater What nodename do you want to access with passwordless SSH from this computer?

type: cloudnode1

\textgreater What is the associated node number?

type: 8101

\textgreater Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

type: yes

\textgreater user@cloudnode1's password:

enter your password

\textgreater Set up complete, try to ssh to now

While remaining logged into cloudnode1 repeat this step for cloudnode2-5 corresponding with node numbers 8102-8105\\


\item Run permissions.sh

In your home, [user@cloudnode1 \textasciitilde{}] \$), type:
./permissions.sh

\textgreater This script changes permissions inside .ssh

\textgreater [sudo] password for user:

enter your password

\textgreater Done!!

Repeat steps 8 and 9 for nodes 2-5\\


\item run rsa-keys.sh

In your home, [user@cloudnode1 \textasciitilde{}] \$), type:
./rsa-keys.sh

Repeat this step on nodes 2-5


\end{enumerate}
